# Steps to run ethereum service (draft)
## Install solidity command line tools
## Install web3j command line tools
## Install geth command line tools
## Start geth (a ethereum client) by using cmd: geth --rpcapi personal,db,eth,net,web3 --rpc --rinkeby
## Update directories in ethereum-service/com/bidhouse/connect/EthereumConnection.java to fit with yours

# Compile .sol file
- In order to compile .sol file, of course, we need a .sol file
- After that, execute this command:  solc <file_name>.sol --bin --abi --optimize -o <destination>
- It will generate 2 files: .bin and .abi
That means your build successful

# Create java wrapper class from .sol file
After above step, we use 2 files which generated by compile .sol file. We use use web3j command line to create java wrapper file by execute this command: web3j solidity generate /home/baotoan/Development/O-HouseAuction/Constract/MovieSale.bin /home/baotoan/Development/O-HouseAuction/Constract/MovieSale.abi -o /home/baotoan/Development/O-HouseAuction/Constract/ -p com.yourcomp.name
It will generate a directory which contains java wrapper file

Just read carefully to understand the code
